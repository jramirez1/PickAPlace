Description:
Pick A Place is a site that was made to help users find a restaurant with a specific food type. The user must add a zip code and have the user select from a variety of food selection which then a list of restaurants will appear with information on them. The restaurants are listed based on the defaults set that the API as it in, the closer the restaurant is the higher it is listed. If the user wants a bit more information they can click on the restaurant name to get a rough idea of where the location is located using google maps.

Documentation:
Pick A Place was made to create something similar to what yelp and google maps have for finding food. By creating an web page using HTML and Flask, we ask the user to add their zip code and have them select what type of food they will like to eat. All of this search will be handle using the free API from Google and use Google Maps. 
Once the user have selected these options, the zip code and food type, the user will then be directed to another page where results of restaurants with the food type will be listed. One more thing, for the search results we limited the results to a 10 mile radius. Within these search results, limited information about the restaurants are shown within the page but the user can click on the restaurant's name to get additional information if so desire.
If the user desire to return to the previous page with the same results they can, but the user wants new search results they must click on the HOME to a direct back to home.html file.
